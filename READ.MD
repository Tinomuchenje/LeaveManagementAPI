Creating a `README.md` file for your project is a great way to provide an overview and guide users or developers on how to set up, run, and contribute to your project. Here's a sample `README.md` for your Leave Management API project:

## Features
- Manage employee leave requests with Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
- Service layer for business logic, allowing easy modification and extension.
- Unit tests using NUnit for service layer.
- API documentation with Swagger UI.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) (or you can use an in-memory SQLite database)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leave-management-api.git
   cd leave-management-api
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Configure the database**:
   - Update the `appsettings.json` file with your SQLite connection string or use the provided one.

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Data Source=leave_management.db"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Apply Migrations** (if needed):
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Run the API**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. The API will be available at `https://localhost:{port}`.

### Running Unit Tests

1. **Navigate to the test project**:
   ```bash
   cd LeaveManagementAPI.Tests
   ```

2. **Run the tests**:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

### Swagger Documentation

Swagger UI is integrated for easy testing and documentation of the API.

1. **Access Swagger UI**:
   Once the application is running, open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   https://localhost:{port}/swagger
   ```

2. You can use the Swagger UI to explore and test the API endpoints.
